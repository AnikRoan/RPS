This project is a recipe management platform that allows users to:

store and organize their own recipes,

generate new recipes with the help of AI,

quickly find relevant recipes using intelligent search.

The main idea of the project is to combine a classic recipe storage system with AI-powered features, making it easier and faster to discover and create recipes based on text input and preferences.

The project focuses on building a reliable backend architecture that can later be extended with new features and integrations.
